# Banff Film Festival 100

Under `docs`, you can find:

- the original PDF listing of movies which was sourced [here](https://www.docdroid.net/lR9Mzcw/banff-movie-festival-pdf).
- a curated text version of the movie listing.
- a transform shell script that converts the text based movie listing into JSON.
- a JSON file which is the output of the transformation above.
- under `docs/versions/` you can find the latest version of the `movies.json` file.
